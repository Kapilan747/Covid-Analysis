COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at uncovering trends, insights, and important findings from WHO publicly available datasets. The analysis primarily uses Python and Pandas for data manipulation, followed by visualization in Tableau to represent the results effectively.

Project Objectives
Understand the global spread of COVID-19.
Identify trends in infection, recovery, and death rates.
Analyze the impact of various factors on the spread of the virus.
Visualize key findings using Tableau dashboards.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes detailed daily records of COVID-19 cases across different countries. It contains information such as:

Date
Country/Region
Confirmed Cases
Deaths
Recoveries
Active Cases
Other demographic and healthcare-related metrics (if applicable)
Source
Data has been sourced from WHO covid Dashboard website.

Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation: Pandas
Data Visualization: Tableau
Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and scripting
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Installation
To replicate the analysis, clone the repository and install the necessary libraries by running:

1.Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Kapilan747/Covid-Analysis.git
```
Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and inconsistent data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic statistical analysis to understand the dataset.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze trends over time.
Comparative Analysis: Compare data across regions, countries, or time periods.
Data Visualization: Visualize key findings using Tableau.
Results
Identified peak infection periods across different regions.
Found correlations between various factors like healthcare infrastructure and infection rates.
Detailed breakdown of infection, recovery, and death rates by country.
Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into how COVID-19 spread across the world and which factors significantly influenced the spread and severity of the pandemic. The visualizations in Tableau allow for a clear understanding of the pandemic's impact globally.

Future Work
Incorporate additional datasets like vaccination rates and government response data.
Perform predictive modeling to forecast future trends in infection rates.
